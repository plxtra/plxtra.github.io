import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide will cover installation of Plxtra XOSP on a standalone Linux machine running Docker, with both LetsEncrypt certificates and a Sample recording of ASX data being continuously replayed.

:::note
A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is an ideal environment in which to host a standalone installation of Plxtra.  There are many suppliers to choose from with a large range of options and quick access.  Suitable instances are priced from approximately $20 (USD) per month depending on your location.
:::

## Specifications

Plxtra is a relatively light-weight installation, with the ability to scale as your needs grow. Basic hardware specifications are as follows:

| Category | Minimum | Recommended |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Architecture | x86-64 | x86-64 |
| VCPUs    | 2 | 4 |
| Memory   | 4GB | 8GB |
| Storage  | 10GB | 20GB |

We recommend a distribution supported by both [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.5). See the table below:

| Supported OS | PowerShell | Docker |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Debian 11 / 12 | [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-debian) | [Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
| RHEL 8 / 9 | [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-rhel?view=powershell-7.5) | [Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/) |
| Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 | [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-ubuntu?view=powershell-7.5) | [Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) |

:::note
Other distributions may require additional work to support Plxtra.

See [PowerShell Community Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/community-support?view=powershell-7.5) for more information.

## Installation

To follow this guide you will need a terminal, and a user with membership in the `docker` group.

<details>
<summary>Optional: Create a new user and group for managing the Plxtra installation</summary>

You will need a root account or sudo access:

```bash frame="none"
su -
```

Create a new user `plxtra` with `docker` access:

```bash frame="none"
groupadd plxtra
useradd -m -g plxtra -G docker plxtra
passwd plxtra
exit
```

Switch to the `plxtra` user to continue this guide:

```bash frame="none"
su plxtra
```
</details>

1. Follow the instructions appropriate to your distribution to install Docker and PowerShell.
2. Start Powershell.
    ```bash frame="none"
    pwsh
    ```

3. Create a folder `xosp`, which will be the location of your XOSP configuration files.
    :::note
    Docker will need the files created here. Do not delete it when you're done!
    :::
    ```powershell frame="none"
    mkdir xosp
    cd xosp
    ```

4. Download an XOSP source code release.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="From a Browser">
XOSP releases are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/plxtra/xosp/releases). The latest release is recommended.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Latest from PowerShell">
```powershell frame="none"
iwr (iwr https://api.github.com/repos/plxtra/xosp/releases/latest | ConvertFrom-Json | select -ExpandProperty tarball_url) -OutFile xosp.tar.gz
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Latest using curl and jq">
If you have the `jq` tool installed, downloading the latest release is easy:

```bash frame="none"
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/plxtra/xosp/releases/latest | jq -r '.tarball_url' | xargs curl -Lso xosp.tar.gz
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Latest using curl and grep">
If you don't have `jq`, a slightly more complicated command will download the latest release:

```bash frame="none"
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/plxtra/xosp/releases/latest | grep '"tarball_url":' | grep -o 'https://[^"]*' | xargs curl -Lso xosp.tar.gz
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

5. Extract the source code release into the `xosp` directory:
    ```bash frame="none"
    tar -xf xosp.tar.gz --strip-components=1
    ```

6. [Configure](../../../deploy/scripts/#xosp-configure) your installation, specifying the [profiles](../../../deploy/profiles/) for LetsEncrypt and the Sample market.
    ```powershell frame="none"
    ./XOSP-Configure.ps1 LetsEncrypt Samples
    ```

    The script will inform you that you need to configure your root domain name. XOSP will use several subdomains beneath it.

7. Edit the `XOSP-Params.json` file and change the `RootDomainName` value to your domain. Use whatever text editor you are familiar with.

    ```powershell frame="none"
    nano XOSP-Params.json
    ```

    ```json
    // XOSP-Params.json
    {
        "RootDomainName":"<Your Root Domain Here>"
        ...
    }
    ```

    :::tip[Reverse Proxy]
    XOSP supports being behind a reverse proxy! Set your `HttpPort` and `HttpsPort` to the ports XOSP should listen to on the host, and your `PublicHttpPort` and `PublicHttpsPort` to 80 and 443 respectively.
    :::

8. Run [Configure](../../../deploy/scripts/#xosp-configure) again. This will apply your new domain configuration. No need to specify the profiles again - it'll remember from last time!
    ```powershell frame="none"
    ./XOSP-Configure.ps1
    ```

    :::note[DNS Registration]
    XOSP makes use of a number of subdomains, which will need accurate DNS records to allow LetsEncrypt to create certificates.

    The following subdomains should be pointed to your host machine's public address IP: `arclight`, `auth`, `expo`, `foundry`, `iq`, `motif`, `svc`, `ws`.
    :::

    :::caution[Firewalls]
    Ensure that any firewall is open for ports 80 and 443.
    :::

9. Run [Install](../../../deploy/scripts/#xosp-install).  This will create all the containers, set them up according to the configuration, and retrieve the LetsEncrypt certificates for your domain.
    ```powershell frame="none"
    ./XOSP-Install.ps1
    ```

If all went well, your Plxtra XOSP installation should now be complete and accessible from the internet.

## Finishing up

There is one final step required, which is to schedule the LetsEncrypt certificate renewal. The `XOSP-Renew.ps1` script is used to perform this task.

You can either schedule it manually to run every 90 days, or if your distribution is using `systemd`, scheduling can be performed automatically with the following command:

```powershell frame="none"
./XOSP-Renew.ps1 install
```

The automated scheduling runs as the current user, rather than system-wide, so you will also need the `lingering` option enabled for your user.

```powershell frame="none"
loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)
```

* User Registration to begin adding new Users and Trading Accounts
* Symbol Registration to add some new symbols
