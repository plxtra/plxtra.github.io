This page provides a detailed description of how to install [Plxtra XOSP](/deploy/what-is-xosp/) onto your local computer.  See the [Quick start](../quick-start/) page for a streamlined description to get you up and running quickly.

## Overview

Plxtra can be installed on any X86-64 based computer whose operating system supports Docker and .NET.  It has been tested on Windows 11.  (Testing on Linux distributions will be carried out shortly)

Installing Plxtra involves:
1. [Installing prerequisites](#prerequisites)
2. [Downloading the XOSP code repository](#download-xosp-code-repository)
3. [Starting Docker](#start-docker)
4. [Running installation scripts in the XOSP code repository](#run-installation-scripts)
5. [Installing the Plxtra certificate](#install-the-plxtra-certificate)
6. [Installing the Plxtra hosts file](#install-the-plxtra-hosts-file)

After the installation is complete, you will be able to [access Plxtra](access-plxtra) using a web browser.  The URL will be shown at the end of the installation process.  You can also access its external APIs with your own applications.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites need to be installed beforehand:
1. **PowerShell**\
The installation scripts are written in PowerShell.

1. **WSL2 (if using Windows)**\
Plxtra uses WSL2 to run Linux containers.  This is only required if you are using Windows.  If you are using Linux, you can skip this step.\

1. **Docker**\
Docker will host the containers which run the Plxtra services.  [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) can be used to view and manipulate these containers.\

## Download XOSP code repository

After ensuring the prerequisites are installed, the next step is to download the XOSP code repository.

The XOSP code repository contains the scripts and configuration files required to install Plxtra.  It also contains the Dockerfiles which are used to build the Docker containers which run the Plxtra services.

The Plxtra XOSP code repository is hosted on GitHub:\
[https://github.com/plxtra/xosp/](https://github.com/plxtra/xosp/)\
You can either clone the repository or download the latest release.  A release is provided as a zip file will and it will need to be unzipped before proceeding.

## Start Docker

Docker needs to be started before running the installation scripts.  The Docker Desktop application can be used to start Docker.  Once started, you should see a green light in the top right corner of the Docker Desktop application.

## Run installation scripts

After Docker has been started, you can use the scripts in the XOSP code repository to install Plxtra.  These scripts are written in PowerShell and need to be run from a PowerShell command prompt.  To do this, open a PowerShell command prompt and navigate to the folder where the XOSP code repository is located.  Then run the following commands:

1. **XOSP-Clear.ps1** (optional)\
This script will stop and remove all Docker containers and images which are running on your computer.  It will also remove the database and any other files created by the installation process.  This script is useful if you want to start the installation process from scratch.
1. **XOSP-Configure.ps1**\
This script will configure the installation.  It will create a folder called `Docker` in the same folder as the XOSP code repository.  This folder will contain the Dockerfiles and configuration files required to build the Docker containers.
1. **XOSP-Install.ps1**\
This script will build the Docker containers and start them.  It will also create a database and install the Plxtra services.  This script will take several minutes to run, depending on your computer's performance.  After the this script has completed, you will see a list of links to the Plxtra services.  You can use these links to access the services in your web browser.  The script will also show you the username and password required to log in to the Plxtra services.  Make sure to note these down as you will need them later.

## Install the Plxtra certificate
The Plxtra services use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the services and the web browser.  To do this, a self-signed certificate is used.  This certificate needs to be installed in your operating system's certificate store and/or your web browser.

The certificate is located in the `Docker` folder (created by the `XOSP-Configure.ps1` script).  The file is called `xosp.crt`.  You will need to install this certificate into your operating system's certificate store and/or your web browser.  For example, on Windows, you can use the `certmgr` command to install it into the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` store.  If you are using Firefox or Safari, you will need to install the certificate directly into the browser.

Note that this certificate is self-signed and should only beused for testing purposes.  Do NOT use it in a production environment.

## Install the Plxtra hosts file
The Plxtra services use a custom domain name to access the services.  This domain name is `xosp.local`.  To access the services, you need to add this domain name to your operating system's hosts file.  

The `XOSP-Install.ps1` script will create a file called `hosts` in the `Docker` folder (created by the `XOSP-Configure.ps1` script).  This file contains the mapping of the domain name to the IP address of the Plxtra services.  You need to copy the contents of this file into your operating system's `hosts` file.  For example, on Windows, you can use the `notepad` command to open the hosts file and copy the contents of the `hosts` file into it.

The operating system's `hosts` file is located in the following location:
* Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
* Linux: `/etc/hosts`
* MacOS: `/etc/hosts`

## Access Plxtra

After Plxtra has been installed, an example exchange called [`XOSP`](/deploy/what-is-xosp/) will have been set up.  This will be accessible whenever Docker is running.  There are several ways you can access it:
* **Web browser**\
You can access the Plxtra services using a web browser.  URLs for various services and applications will be shown at the end of the `XOSP-Install.ps1` installation process together with the username and password for an Admin account. (Best to record these).  
* **External APIs**\
You can access the Plxtra services using its external APIs.
* **Debug applications**\
You can use the Plxtra services to debug your own applications from within your development environment.
