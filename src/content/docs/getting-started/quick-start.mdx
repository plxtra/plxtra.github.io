This guide quickly steps you through a private installation of Plxtra XOSP. See [Install](../install/) for more detailed instructions.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need a host machine with:

1. A recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) installed and running.
1. [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) installed on the machine for installation.
1. (Windows only) An installation of [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on Windows 10 (22H2) or 11.

## Installation

1. Start with a PowerShell terminal.
2. Create a folder that will contain your XOSP installation and configuration scripts.
    ```powershell frame="none"
    mkdir $HOME\xosp
    cd $HOME\xosp
    ```

3. Download an XOSP release from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/plxtra/xosp/releases) and extract it locally.
    ```powershell frame="none"
    iwr (iwr https://api.github.com/repos/plxtra/xosp/releases/latest | ConvertFrom-Json | select -ExpandProperty tarball_url) -OutFile xosp.tar.gz
    tar -xf xosp.tar.gz --strip-components=1
    ```

4. Configure XOSP and verify your environment configuration. If you encounter any problems, follow the instructions on-screen.
    ```powershell frame="none"
    ./XOSP-Configure.ps1
    ```

5. Install XOSP. This will install the containers and configure the services. If you encounter any problems, follow the instructions on-screen.
    ```powershell frame="none"
    ./XOSP-Install.ps1
    ```

# Finishing Installation

A successful installation will finish with a set of manual steps, along with some links and login credentials to use the system.

:::note
All manual steps must be performed before your installation will be available from a web browser.
:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Windows">
1. Install the generated SSL certificate `Docker\xosp.crt` into your operating system's certificate store and/or your browser.

    For Chrome/Edge, the certificate can be installed from PowerShell:

    ```powershell frame="none"
    Import-Certificate -FilePath Docker\xosp.crt -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root
    ```

    For [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1059377) or Safari, you will need to install the certificate directly into the browser.

    :::note
    Make sure to restart your browser after this step!
    :::

2. Create DNS aliases for the Plxtra installation, by copying the contents of the `Docker\hosts` file into your operating systems `hosts` file.

    ```powershell frame="none"
    start notepad "Docker\hosts"
    start -Verb RunAs notepad C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
    ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux">
1. Install the generated SSL certificate `Docker/xosp.crt` into your browser certificate store.\
    Instructions are available for [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1059377).

    ```bash frame="none"
    cat Docker/hosts | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```
</TabItem>
