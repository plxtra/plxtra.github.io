title: Architecture Principles
---
Plxtra has been architected around the following principles:

* **Modular**: Components have clearly defined roles and APIs, each focused on its area of expertise.
* **Customisable**: APIs and plugins enable extensibility and integration at both server and client.
* **Available**: Designed for both scalability and redundancy, from single instances up to large clusters, to support any amount of load and reliability requirements.
* **Realtime**: Create markets, issue symbols, add accounts and users, trade, and settle, all in realtime. Batch processing is also supported.
* **Full stack retail-focused**: From registry to phone and desktop, Plxtra provides a full suite of trading components needed for retail trading.
* **Broker support**: Providing trading infrastructure to brokers to run their operations and meet their market participation obligations.
* **Not high-frequency**: It is intended for retail systems (supported by brokers), optimised for throughput with a large number of customers.
* **CRM via integration**: Allows each customer to use business management systems that suit their own operations.
