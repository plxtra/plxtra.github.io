*Component: [OMS](../../../components/back-end/oms/)*

The Trade Feed Adapter generates a specialised feed which assists settlement and registries from booking trades to accounts and generating contract notes.  It is also used to reconcile the days trading reported by the [Order Management](./order-management/) with the transactional changes in the registry/settlement system.

These feeds are normally very specific to the registry/settlement system.  Plxtra has various integration points to support the development of these feeds.
