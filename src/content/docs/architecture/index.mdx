## Principles

Plxtra has been architected around the following principles:

* **Modular**: Components have clearly defined roles and APIs, each focused on its area of expertise.
* **Customisable**: APIs and plugins enable extensibility and integration at both server and client.
* **Available**: Designed for both scalability and redundancy, from single instances up to large clusters, to support any amount of load and reliability requirements.
* **Realtime**: Create markets, issue symbols, add accounts and users, trade, and settle, all in realtime. Batch processing is also supported.
* **Full stack retail-focused**: From registry to phone and desktop, Plxtra provides a full suite of trading components needed for retail trading.
* **Broker support**: Providing trading infrastructure to brokers to run their operations and meet their market participation obligations.
* **Not high-frequency**: It is intended for retail systems (supported by brokers), optimised for throughput with a large number of customers.
* **CRM via integration**: Allows each customer to use business management systems that suit their own operations.

## Block overview

The following diagrams provide a high level overview of Plxtra.

### Exchange Platform

At the highest level, Plxtra is a full exchange as shown below:

![Exchange platform block overview](./exchange-platform-top-level-block.excalidraw.svg)

The main components are:

* **[{ ComponentShort.registry.label }](./backend/registry/)**: { ComponentShort.registry.description }
* **[{ ComponentShort.exchangeEngine.label }](./backend/exchange-engine/)**: { ComponentShort.exchangeEngine.description }
* **[{ ComponentShort.fixServer.label }](./backend/fix-server/)**: { ComponentShort.fixServer.description }
* **Brokerage Platform**: Implements services typically operated by a broker 

### Brokerage Platform

The diagram below is an overview of the Brokerage Platform as typically used by a broker.

Note that when used as part of the Plxtra exchange platform (above), this does not imply that an exchange needs to have a broker.  In this case, the exchange itself essentially carries out the brokerage operations.  Also, note that this diagram shows an external registry/settlement (as would typically be the case with brokers) whereas the Plxtra exchange platform itself already contains a registry.
