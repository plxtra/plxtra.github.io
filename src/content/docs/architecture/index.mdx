Plxtra has been architected around these [principles](./principles/).

It can be configured in meet various trading platform use cases.  For example:

* A full retail exchange platform with registry, exchange engine, FIX server, and brokerage platform,
* A retail exchange platform using an external registry,
* An exchange platform with multiple brokers,
* A brokerage platform connecting to one or more external exchanges.

The following 2 use cases provide a good summary of Plstra's top level architecture.

## Full Exchange Platform

At the highest level, Plxtra is a full exchange as shown below:

The main components are:

* **[{ ComponentShort.registry.label }](./backend/registry/)**: { ComponentShort.registry.description }
* **[{ ComponentShort.exchangeEngine.label }](./backend/exchange-engine/)**: { ComponentShort.exchangeEngine.description }
* **[{ ComponentShort.fixServer.label }](./backend/fix-server/)**: { ComponentShort.fixServer.description }
* **Brokerage Platform**: Implements services typically operated by a broker 

## Brokerage Platform

The diagram below is an overview of the Brokerage Platform as typically used by a broker.

Note that when used as part of the Plxtra exchange platform (above), this does not imply that an exchange needs to have a broker.  In this case, the exchange itself essentially carries out the brokerage operations.  Also, note that this diagram shows an external registry/settlement (as would typically be the case with brokers) whereas the Plxtra exchange platform itself already contains a registry.
