import FunctionalityShortItem from '@components/FunctionalityShortItem.astro';
import { FunctionalityShort } from '@shared';

Plxtra has been architected around these [principles](./principles/).

## Functionalities

The diagram below shows a top level view of the functionality within the Brokerage Platform.

![Brokerage platform block overview](./brokerage-platform-top-level-functionality.excalidraw.svg)

Note that when used as part of the Plxtra exchange platform (above), this does not imply that an exchange needs to have a broker.  The exchange itself can carry out the brokerage operations.  Also, note that this diagram shows an external registry/settlement (as would typically be the case with brokers) whereas the Plxtra exchange platform itself already contains a registry.

The functionalities are:

* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.feedServer} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.tradingAdapter} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.tradeFeedAdapter} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.orderManagement} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.tradingAgent} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.vetting} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.authority} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.cachingProxy} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.alertingScanning} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.motif} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.arclight} />
* <FunctionalityShortItem short={FunctionalityShort.motifXL} />

## Components

The above functionalities are implemented in various Plxtra components. The full list of components can be accessed [here](./components/).
