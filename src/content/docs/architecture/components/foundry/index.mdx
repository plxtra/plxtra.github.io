Foundry is a registry platform designed to manage ownership records for securities, tokens, and other trade-related instruments. Built on the principles of double-entry accounting, it can serve as the primary source of truth or synchronize with external systems like banks, clearing houses, or upstream registries.

In realtime it tracks both cash and security holdings, processes transactions to settle trades, and offers services for deposits, withdrawals, share issues, etc.

## Key Features

### Trading-Focused Accounting System

Foundry is a multi-tenant accounting system tailored for trading and settlement operations. It can be configured to mirror the structure of entities and assets within an exchange.

Each Foundry installation supports multiple registry operators, each managing:

* Entity Types: Examples include Issuer, Investor, and Trading Account. These can be organized hierarchically and assigned searchable attributes.
* Asset Types: Such as Currency or Token.
* Ledgers: These connect an entity to an asset and track transactions between them.

Examples:

* A ledger linking a Trading Account to Currency tracks cash balances.
* A ledger linking a Trading Account to a Token tracks asset holdings.
* Ledgers can also connect other combinations, like Issuer to Currency.

Transactions are recorded using customizable Record types, each processed by a dedicated handler that creates a matching debit and credit entry. Foundry supports plugin-based extensions for new transaction types.

### Real-Time Synchronization Registry

Foundry also functions as a real-time synchronization registry, maintaining up-to-date records of accounts, transactions, holdings, and cash balances.

It can:

* Act as the authoritative record or sync with upstream systems (e.g., banks or clearing houses).
* Operate as a sub-registry, tracking individual balances under an aggregate account (e.g., omnibus accounts).

Real-time integrations include:

* Order Management Systems (OMS) for tracking filled orders.
* Ensuring withdrawals respect existing reservations.
* Syncing external transactions like deposits or share dilutions.

Connectivity Overview:

* Interfaces with bank accounts, upstream registries, and OMS.
* Manages user-initiated withdrawals and upstream-initiated deposits.
* Applies business rules and vetting for transactions.

Foundry offers a highly customizable and extensible solution for managing financial instruments and registry operations in modern trading environments.
