title: Components overview
---

Plxtra offers components for multiple scenarios, such as running a self-hosted digital exchange, offering brokerage operations over external third-party exchanges, or any combination of both.
This includes an exchange with realtime order execution and matching, a registry with accounting of cash and holdings, a order management system for routing and vetting, a realtime data distribution platform for both market and trading data, and three web-facing client applications to build upon.
These are supported by a suite of systems such as cross-application watchlists, auditing and session reporting, holiday tracking, news feeds, and realtime market scanning.

## Not included

Plxtra is intended for use alongside existing industry-standard software relating to customer management and back office, and does not include a production-ready authentication server, or features providing a CRM or back-office. Instead, standard OAuth and OIDC interfaces can be used for authentication, while a suite of REST APIs can be used to manipulate and monitor the platform.
