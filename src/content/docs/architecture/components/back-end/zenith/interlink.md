title: Interlink
---

Zenith [Caching Proxies](../../../../functionalities/back-end/caching-proxy/) need to communicate with each other and with [plugins](../../zenith/#backendplugin) with high speed connections to quickly request and stream information.  They do this with Interlink connections.

Interlink connections are TCP socket connections with messaging protocols optimised for Zenith communications.  The protocol can be easily extended as new features are incorporated into Zenith.
