Motif is a browser based extensible trading terminal, intended for desktop environments and for both retail customer and broker usage.

## Concepts

Motif is built to expose the full power of the Plxtra platform, providing access to everything the system has available.

## Extensibility

* Apply your own branding to the application, to give it a look and feel unique to your business.
* Extensions can add new windows and features (like custom charting) to the application. Integrate your own business logic directly into Motif itself.
