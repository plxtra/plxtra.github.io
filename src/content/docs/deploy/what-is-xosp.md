title: What is XOSP
---

XOSP is both:
1. The name of the source code repository which contains the Docker script and code used to deploy Plxtra.
1. The name of the example exchange that is built into the XOSP source code repository to demonstrate Plxtra.

In the future, we aim to improve the Docker scripts and code to more clearly separate general installation from specific exchanges.  We will then remove this overload of the XOSP term.
