Plxtra's [exchange engine](/architecture/functionalities/exchange-engine/) matches orders to generate trades. It can simultaneously host and run multiple markets or boards with its plugin design. Third parties can access it via industry standard [FIX](/architecture/functionalities/fix-server/) protocol. A [market control API](/market-control-api/) allows it to be integrated into an organisation's business systems.
