The rules for a market are implemented in a [Prodigy]({{< ref "/platforms/documentation/prodigy" >}}) plugin. To change the rules, only the plugin needs to be modified - not the whole matching engine. Adding a new market or board, only requires a new plugin to be created. Market development has become a lot easier and faster.
