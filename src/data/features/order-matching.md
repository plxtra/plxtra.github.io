Prodigy is Plxtra's order matching engine. It can simultaneously host and run multiple markets or boards with its plugin design. Third parties can access it via industry standard [FIX]({{< ref "/platforms/documentation/technology/fix" >}}) protocol. A management API can also be made available allowing third parties to manage listings.
