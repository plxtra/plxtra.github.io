Plxtra's [Zenith](/architecture/components/zenith/) uses [caching proxies](/architecture/functionalities/caching-proxy/) with [data](/architecture/functionalities/feed-server/) and [trading](/architecture/functionalities/trading-adapter/) plugins to efficiently deliver data to [API Services](/api/) and can easily scale to meet any demand.  Its plugin design easily allows new data sources (eg. exchanges) to be added.
