Plxtra has a [plugin](/architecture/components/zenith/) architecture that allows exchanges to be easily added to the system.  Support for new exchanges and other [data](/architecture/functionalities/feed-server/) or [trading](/architecture/functionalities/trading-adapter/) sources can usually be added in a couple of months.
