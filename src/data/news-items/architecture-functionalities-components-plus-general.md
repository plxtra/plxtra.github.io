The [Architecture](/architecture/) part of documentation has been split into [`Functionalities`](/architecture/functionalities/) and [`Components`](/architecture/components/). `Functionalities` provides a function oriented breakdown of Plxtra overall capabilities whereas `Components` describes how the functionalities are implemented.

In addition there are many other content improvements.
