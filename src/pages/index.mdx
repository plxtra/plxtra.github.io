# Why Choose Plxtra?

Plxtra offers a powerful alternative to traditional closed-source trading platforms. Originally developed by Paritech/Motif Markets for brokers and exchanges in Australia, New Zealand, and Malaysia, it was open sourced in 2025 to foster innovation and accessibility. <MoreSvg href="/about/history/" />

# Customizing for Your Environment

To deploy Plxtra effectively, you will need to integrate it with your business systems such as:

- CRM
- Identity and access management
- Monitoring tools

Plxtra does not include these business systems such as they are difficult to standardise and are very dependent on organisations' other infrastructure. They vary considerably from organisation to organisation. Instead, Plxtra provides [APIs](/api/#business-systems-integration) which enable Plxtra to be tightly integrated into an organisation's business systems.

In addition, you may also need to develop or configure:

- Exchange connectivity
- Custom extensions
- Specialized data feeds

[APIs](/api/) are provided for these integrations and customisations.
