The philosphy of Plxtra is to provide a core platform that avoids operator specific behaviour.  It does not provide functions like CRM, identity, monitoring systems and other administrative tasks which are normally implemented differently by operators and often integrated into the operator's wider IT infrastructure.  Instead it provides API that allows operators to integrate Plxtra into their administrative tools and other IT infrastructure.

In addition, operators may also need to provide extensions to Plxtra to support their environment.  For example, a brokerage operator may need to configure or develop new feeds for exchanges they connect to.  Plxtra has many extensibility points allowing operators to customise/enhance/extends the capabilities of Plxtra.  Plxtra does not make any claim on any intellectual property within extensions written by external parties.
