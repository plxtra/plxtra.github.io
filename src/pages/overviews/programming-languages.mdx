import AltMainBackground from '@components/AltMainBackground.astro';

Plxtra applications and services are programmed in either:
* C# (back-end)
* TypeScript (front-end)

Both these languages are in wide spread use, productive, have free tooling and developers for these can easily be engaged.

<AltMainBackground>
It is important to note that these languages have been chosen more so for their productivity rather than their performance.  While they are sufficiently performant to provide an excellent user trading experience, they allow developers to more quickly develop and test new features and improvements.  Making engineering affordable is a prime objective of Plxtra.
