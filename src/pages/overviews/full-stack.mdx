Plxtra has all the trading components needed to run a retail exchange or brokerage.

# Advantage

The big advantage of full stack is that you do not require any further third party trading components to run a [retail exchange or brokerage](/solutions/).  This greatly reduces costs and technical complexity.

Note however, Plxtra has been designed to be extensible and modular, so you can easily add third party components to better meet your operational requirements.

# Business systems

Plxtra does not include business systems such as CRM, listing manager, authentication and monitoring.  These are difficult to standardise as they are very dependent on organisations' other infrastructure and vary considerably from organisation to organisation.  Instead, Plxtra provides [APIs](/api/#business-systems-integration) which enable Plxtra to be tightly integrated into an organisation's business systems.
