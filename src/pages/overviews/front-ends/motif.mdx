Motif is a powerful extensible trading terminal that comes with Plxtra. It combines the deployment benefits of being web based but with the feel and usability of a desktop application. Traders and advisors will appreciate the professional feature set. But the most important feature is its ability to be enhanced with extensions (add-ons).

Many other types of software products support extensions. With extensions, a software application is no longer dependent on its organisationâ€™s developers for new features. Typically, users wish for lots of extra features; some important, some innovative, some to meet their specific needs. There is no way an organisation can implement these features in-house. Extensions allow other third parties to implement these features.
