A powerful business rules engine is absolutely essential in a trading platform today. Business models for security trading are becoming more sophisticated and having to operate in tighter regulatory environments. An engine must both, have the power needed to implement the desired rules and also have configurability to handle the ongoing evolution of business models and regulations.

* A powerful scripting engine which supports conditional evaluation,
* Rules can be specified at different levels of the account hierarchy,
* Exchange rules are separated from business rules,
* Easy configuration of business rules by Administrators,
* Changes are immediately applied when saved,
* All changes are tracked with an audit log.
