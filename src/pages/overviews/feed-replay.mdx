import AltMainBackground from '@components/AltMainBackground.astro';

Plxtra includes a feed replay system that makes it possible to set up ["`Sample`" exchanges](/using/deploy/#recordings). These exchanges receive market data from a recorded feed.  They appear like the real exchange however it is not possible to trade on them.

<AltMainBackground>
`Sample` exchanges are ideal for developing and testing applications which use Plxtra [APIs](/api/) to access exchange data. They provide a realistic environment without needing connectivity to a live exchange, allowing developers to simulate various market conditions and scenarios.
