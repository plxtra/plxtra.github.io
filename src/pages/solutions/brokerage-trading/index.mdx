The retail securities brokerage market is changing.  Margins are falling while customer expectations are increasing.  Brokers operating in the retail space are reconsidering their platforming.

Previously, retail brokers established their infrastructure in a similar manner to institutional brokers.  Typically sourcing from the same suppliers but using lower end products and then integrating these in a similar fashion.  However this infrastructure is no longer profitable in today's competitive landscape.

Retail Brokers now need a trading platform with the features and pricing tuned to the retail broking.
