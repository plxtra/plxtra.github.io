Plxtra is ideal for specialised exchanges.  For example Carbon Exchanges or [Sustainability Credits](https://www.motifmarkets.com/sustainability-credits/) exchanges. It is a full stack with a pluggable matching engine architecture allowing it to be easily modified to meet the needs of different trading systems. (eg credit schemes). It is also designed for regulated trading of equities with the reliability and features needed by operators, traders and regulators.
