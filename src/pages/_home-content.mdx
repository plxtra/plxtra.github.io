# Why open source?

Most trading platform software is closed source. This has the advantage that vendors can better exploit their intellectual property and have full control over its development to best align it with the market's and their customers' needs.

However if the development engineering cost needed to meet customers' (or regulatory) increasing expectations begins to impact profitability, then the open source model of software development may become more advantageous.  The effort to develop the core platform is shared but vendors can differentiate and compete by extending and customising the core.  In addition, the software skills to develop the core can be quite different to customising.  Vendors can better focus their software development skill resourcing on customisation.

The complexity of developing trading platforms is already affecting the ability of startups and small organisations to afford these platforms from closed source vendors.  This problem also has a large impact on market development by national security exchanges.  They cannot roll out new features and capabilities unless all their brokers, data distributors and other connected organisations update their systems to support the new features.  So the exchanges are limited in market development by the capability and profitability of their connected organisations' vendors.

For the above reasons, long term, the growth of open source trading platform is probably inevitable.
